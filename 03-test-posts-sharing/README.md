This project starts off with a complete copy of [v8.0.0](https://github.com/TranXuanHoang/NodeJS/releases/tag/v8.0.0) of the [02-posts-sharing](../02-posts-sharing) project source code. In this project, automated tests are added so that whenever new changes are added the source code can be automatically tested using CI/CD tools.

The post sharing app is constituted by

* a [backend](./backend) app (written in Node.js) that provides `RESTful` APIs serving data and authentication/authorization.
* and a [frontend](./frontend) app (written in [`React`](https://reactjs.org/)) that is the UI for users to interact with.
