# Basics of Node.js

A simple example web app written with Node.js without using other frameworks like [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).

## Run App

* Install dependency packages with `npm install`.

* Run `node app.js` and open the web app at `localhost:3000`. While developing the app, we can also run `npm start` - this will automatically restart the app whenever new changes are added to the source code.

* To debug app, install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally with `npm i -g nodemon`, then [in VS Code run debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging) by calling `Run > Start Debugging`.
